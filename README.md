# Conductor2 (WIP)

## This project is a rebuild/update of my LEGO train control system.

The train's infra-red control system has been replaced with an Arduino based microcontroller using WiFi, and is controlled via pub-sub messages instead.

I am currently rebuilding everything from scratch, so this is a work in progress (isn't it always? :D ).
