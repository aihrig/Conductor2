# Conductor2 (WIP)

## This project is a rebuild/update of my LEGO train control system.

#

I replaced train's infra-red control system with an ESP32 using Arduino C++.  It makes an internet connection using WiFi (initially configured through a captive portal), and is controlled via pub-sub message (throw away keys right now).

I am currently rebuilding everything from scratch, so things are not all there yet, and are in `debug` and `todo` modes.

More to come...
